# grocery-list-generator

This is my grocery list generator app written in python using flask. 
The webpage is structuted with HTML and CSS to add some old-school cooking flare. 
It is deployed via App Engine in GCP, and can be accessed here: https://my-recipe-project-429118.ue.r.appspot.com/

To use the app simply select the recipes you'd like to make from the menu and click "Generate Grocery List." 
The app will then genertae a list of all the necessary ingredients to get at the grocery store.
